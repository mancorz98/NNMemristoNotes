  abstract       = {Memristor devices have diverse physical models depending on their structure. In addition, the physical properties of memristors are described using complex differential equations. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate the various models of memristor into an unified physics-based model. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based compact memristor model. PINNs can solve complex differential equations intuitively and with ease. This methodology is used to conduct memristor physical analysis. The weight and bias extracted from the PINN are implemented in a Verilog-A circuit simulator to predict memristor device characteristics. The accuracy of the proposed model is verified using two memristor devices. The results show that PINNs can be used to extensively integrate memristor device models.},
